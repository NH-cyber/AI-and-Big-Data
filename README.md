# AI-and-Big-Data
This is a repository for my AI and Big Data Analytics capstone project 

# Overview 
This project uses supervised machine learning algorithms to predict network traffic flow. It involves preprocessing labeled data, training models like Decision Trees and Random Forests, and evaluating their performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

# Features 
    Network traffic data preprocessing and visualization

    Supervised ML models: Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, etc.

    Performance comparison and evaluation

    Developed using Python and Google Colab

    Visual insights with matplotlib and seaborn
